# Network-Information-API
A responsive Next.js app using React, Tailwind CSS, and the Network Information API to adapt content based on user connection. It loads high or low-res images depending on network speed and updates in real time. Just clone, install, and run to see it in action.
This project is a responsive web app built with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, designed to dynamically adapt content based on the user's network conditions using the Network Information API. It detects connection type (like 4g, 3g, or 2g) and whether data-saving mode is enabled, then intelligently loads either high-resolution or low-resolution images to optimize performance. The app updates in real time as network conditions change, offering a smooth and efficient user experience. Just clone the repo, install dependencies, and run the development server to see it in action.
